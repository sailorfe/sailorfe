## about

hi! i'm sailorfe (sailor mars) and welcome to my github! i actually use [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sailorfe) to host my projects and especially linux dotfiles, but you'll see me mirror stuff for discoverability. i'm admittedly a dilettente changing careers to IT, but i've coded in some form since i was eight years old thanks to neopets pet pages. through the power of open source, i'm now a fair bash scripter learning python and lua in public.

## what i'm hacking on

most of what i make so far is modular astrology applications for unix in lieu of me ever learning C++ to mess with my *favorite* software, walter pullen's [astrolog](https://github.com/CruiserOne/Astrolog). this is all possible thanks to [pyswisseph](https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph)!

since i have a ton of web dev in my pocket, there's also a few static websites knocking about here, too.
